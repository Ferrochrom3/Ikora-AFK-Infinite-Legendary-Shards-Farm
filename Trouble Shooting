Trouble Shooting:

Q: Why doesn't my mouse move to the exotic when the macro starts?
A: It turns out Ikora's text length for exotic are different for different exotics. Try the following to find your exact coordinates.
Add the following lines after line 27, which line 27 is while run:
print(pyautogui.position())
break

Run the file, it will give you your current mouse location (make sure to put your mouse where you wanted it to before executing). Then it's going to break out of the loop to prevent further execution. Just remove those two lines of code after you found your coords. The coordiates you get will be your new ikora_x_pos and ikora_y_pos.

Q: Why can't I install pyautogui or keyboard?
A: First make sure pip is install on your system, you can do that in custom installaion. If pip isn't recognized, try add "python -m" or "python3 -m" in from of pip install.

Additionally, if "add Python to environment variables" is not checked in the Advanced Options page, check that box. (do this step before going after "python -m" or "python3)
